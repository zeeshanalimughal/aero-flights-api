# AeroAPI Node Express Api Routes

AeroAPI is a simple, query-based API that gives software developers access to a variety of FlightAware's flight data. Users can obtain current or historical data. AeroAPI is a RESTful API delivering accurate and actionable aviation data. With the introduction of Foresight™, customers have access to the data that powers over half of the predictive airline ETAs in the US.

## Categories

AeroAPI is divided into several categories to make things easier to discover.

Flights: Summary information, planned routes, positions and more
Foresight: Flight positions enhanced with FlightAware Foresight™
Airports: Airport information and FIDS style resources
Operators: Operator information and fleet activity resources
Alerts: Configure flight alerts and delivery destinations
History: Historical flight access for various endpoints
Miscellaneous: Flight disruption, future schedule information, and aircraft owner information
