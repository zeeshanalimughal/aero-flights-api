# AeroAPI Node Express Api Routes

AeroAPI is a simple, query-based API that gives software developers access to a variety of FlightAware's flight data. Users can obtain current or historical data. AeroAPI is a RESTful API delivering accurate and actionable aviation data. With the introduction of Foresight™, customers have access to the data that powers over half of the predictive airline ETAs in the US.
